#JavaScript Multiplication Tool with Error Handling
#Overview
-This project is a simple web application that allows users to input two numerical values and perform a multiplication operation. It demonstrates how to handle errors effectively using try and catch blocks in JavaScript, ensuring smooth execution and providing helpful feedback to users.

#Objectives
-User Input: Provides two input fields for users to enter numerical values.
-Operation Execution: Multiplies the two input values when the "Perform Operation" button is clicked.
-Error Handling: Checks if the entered values are valid numbers before performing the multiplication operation. If the values are not valid numbers, it displays an error message instead of the result.
-Debugging: Includes a debugger statement within the multiply() function to pause execution, allowing developers to inspect the code, variables, and execution flow using browser Developer Tools.
#Technologies
_HTML
-JavaScript
#Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of HTML
Basic understanding of the console and debugging techniques
A web browser with developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Firefox Console)
#Debugging Tips
-To use the debugger, open your browser's Developer Tools (usually F12 or right-click -> Inspect).
Navigate to the "Sources" tab, and set breakpoints or use the "Step Over" functionality to inspect the flow of your code.
Check the console for error messages or logged values.
#Conclusion
-This project serves as a practical example of error handling and debugging in JavaScript. By utilizing try and catch blocks, you can ensure that your application handles invalid user input gracefully and provides a better user experience.
